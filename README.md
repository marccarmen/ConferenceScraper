# ConferenceScraper
This project was started as a way to generate word/lemma lists based on the General Conference talks from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The word/lemma lists are ordered by the most frequent. An end-user could then use that to create a list of vocabulary words to learn in the target language.

Currently the end-user inputs the target language, month (April or October), and the year. I am planning to update the month and year options to allow the end-user input both months and multiple years. This would allow the end-user to generate a list based on more data.
